# Linear Programming Solver

A Python library for parsing and solving linear programming problems using LaTeX input and the Simplex method.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
1. **Parser and Standard Form Converter** (`lp_parser.py`): Parses LaTeX-formatted linear programming problems and converts them to standard form (minimization with equality constraints).
2. **Simplex Solver** (`simplex_solver.py`): Solves linear programming problems in standard form using the Simplex method, outputting detailed iterations in LaTeX.

**Created by Gabriel S. Delgado with assistance from Grok 3 by xAI.**

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
